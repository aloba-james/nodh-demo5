Client API Library
Overview
The Client API Library provides a convenient way to interact with the server's API endpoints. It abstracts away the underlying HTTP requests and authentication details, making it easier for developers to integrate server functionality into their applications.

Installation

You can install the client library using pip:

pip install git+https://github.com/aloba-james/nodh-demo5/client_api.git

Usage
Initialization
To use the client library, you first need to initialize a client object with the base URL of the server and optionally provide authentication details:

from client_api import APIClient

# Initialize client with base URL
client = APIClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000")

# Optionally provide authentication token
client.set_auth_token("YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN")
Making Requests
Once the client is initialized, you can make requests to the server's API endpoints using the corresponding methods provided by the client object. For example, to make a POST request:

# Example POST request
data = {"username": "example", "password": "password123"}
response = client.post("/user/create", data)
print(response)
Handling Responses
The response from the server is returned as a dictionary object, which you can then process accordingly in your application logic.

# Example response handling
if response.get("success"):
    print("User created successfully!")
else:
    print("Error:", response.get("error"))
Error Handling
In case of any errors during request execution, the client library raises appropriate exceptions, which you can catch and handle in your code.


try:
    # Make request
    response = client.get("/endpoint")
except APIClientError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
